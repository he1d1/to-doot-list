This guide assumes you have `git`, `nodejs` and `npm` installed.

1. Install yarn (a package manager) by running ``npm install --global yarn``.
2. Clone the website and go into the folder
   with ``git clone https://github.com/hiluw/to-doot-list.git && cd to-doot-list``.
3. Install all the dependencies with ``yarn install``.
4. Deployment
    1. To deploy for development run ``yarn dev``.
    2. To deploy for production, run ``yarn build && yarn serve`` which will output files into the `dist/` directory,
       put these in a web server.
5. Enjoy!
